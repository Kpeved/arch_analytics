Once this page is closed, an event <b>dashboard_read</b> is sent. \n \nRegolith-hosted rare earth element deposits (also known as ion-adsorption deposits) are rare-earth element (REE) ores in decomposed rocks that are formed by intense weathering of REE-rich parental rocks (e.g. granite, tuff etc.) in subtropical areas.[2] In these areas, rocks are intensely broken and decomposed.[3] Then, REEs infiltrate downward with rain water and they are concentrated along a deeper weathered layer beneath the ground surface.[4]

Extraction technology of the deposits has been evolving over the last 50 years. In the past, REEs were primarily extracted in small amount as by-products in mines of other metals or granitic sands at the beach.[3] However, in recent decades, the development of the high-tech industries (e.g. aerospace engineering, telecommunication etc.) leads to high demand for REEs.[5] Hence, regolith-hosted rare earth element deposits were recognised and extraction technologies have been rapidly developed since the 1980s.[6]

Currently, China dominates more than 95% of the global REE production.[7] Regolith-hosted rare earth element deposits, which contributes 35% of China\'s REE production, are mainly found in South China.[8]</string>
